## Learning Style
* **Definition**: Learning styles are those educational conditions under which a student is most likely to learn (Stewart and Felicetti, 1992).
* **Focus**: How users are preferred to learn
* **Warning**: We should not divide the population into a set of categories (i.e., visual and auditory learners). The system should to be `flexable`.

### Exist opinions on learning style
* There is disagreement on how to best measure learning styles 
* That is, most researchers agree that we do have various learning styles and preferences, however, the research tends to agree that it is relatively unimportant when designing learning programs. 
* Rather it is far more important to `match the presentation with the nature of the subject`, such as providing correct learning methods, strategies, and context; rather than `matching individual preferences`
* “just varying delivery style may not be enough and... the unit of analysis must be `the individual` rather than the group.”
* Learning styles for a group are unimportant, while learning styles for an `individual` are key components

### How to use learning style info
* Firstly, instructional strategies should first be determined on the basis of the type of content to be taught or the goals of the instruction (`the content-by-strategy interactions`).
* Secondarily, `learner styles and preferences` are then used to adjust or fine-tune these fundamental learning strategies. 
* Finally, `content-by-strategy interactions` take precedence over learning-style-by-strategy interactions regardless of the instructional style or philosophy of the instructional situation. 
* Choosing the best learning method is part of metalearning—being aware of and taking control of one's learning (Biggs, 1985). This concept is related to metacognition.
*  setting goals, choosing appropriate strategies, and monitoring progress 
*  Using learning styles as a tool to help learners learn-to-learn, rather that an instrument for stereotyping them into using a particular style, could help them to target one or more styles to fit a strategy for a particular learning need.
